* Data folder 
Data from Eli Shlizerman and Jimin Kim (https://github.com/shlizee/C-elegans-Neural-Interactome)
Based on the original data from Varshney et. al 2011 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001066)

* Results folder
Adjacency Matrices for chemical synapses and gap junctions in CSV format

** Chem.csv: 
- 2217 Chemical synapses
- Inhibitory synapses represented as negative elements 

** Gap.csv:
- 1080 bidirectional gap junctions
- Forced bidirectionality by adding 15 gap junctions to make the original data symmetrical

** Gap_no15.csv 
- 1050 bidirectional gap junctions
- Forced bidirectionality by removing the 15 non-symmetric gap junctions from the original data

** Labels.csv
- Names of the neurons in the order they appear in the adjacency matrices
